# AMA Technical Q\&A 

## 1. What is a Primary Key?

A **primary key** is a unique identifier for each record in a database table. It ensures that:

* Each record is unique (no duplicates).
* The key cannot be `NULL`.

Example in SQL:

sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT
);


Here, `StudentID` is the primary key.

## 2. What is a Lambda Function?

A **lambda function** in Python is an anonymous (nameless) function defined using the `lambda` keyword. It is typically used for short, one-time operations.

Example:

```python
square = lambda x: x ** 2
print(square(5))  # Output: 25
```

---

## 3. What is a Static Method in Python?

A **static method** is a method inside a class that does not access or modify class or instance-specific data. It is defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator.

Example:

```python
class Math:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

print(Math.add(5, 3))  # Output: 8
```

## 4. What is a Generator in Python?

A **generator** is a function that yields values one at a time using the `yield` keyword instead of returning them all at once. It is memory-efficient because it generates values on demand.

Example:

```python
def generate_numbers(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i

for num in generate_numbers(5):
    print(num)
```

Output:

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

## 5. Explain ACID Properties

ACID properties ensure reliable database transactions:

* **A (Atomicity):** All operations in a transaction complete successfully or none at all.
* **C (Consistency):** The database moves from one valid state to another.
* **I (Isolation):** Concurrent transactions do not affect each other.
* **D (Durability):** Once a transaction is committed, it remains permanent even after system failures.

## 6. What is an Object in Python?

An **object** is an instance of a class in Python. It represents real-world entities and encapsulates data (attributes) and behavior (methods).

Example:

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

my_car = Car("Tesla", "Model 3")
print(my_car.brand)  # Output: Tesla
```

## 7. What are slef closing Tags in HTML?

<br />   <!-- line break -->

<img src="car.jpg" alt="Car" />   <!-- image -->

<hr />   <!-- horizontal line -->

<input type="text" />   <!-- input field -->

<meta charset="UTF-8" /> <!-- metadata -->

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" /> <!-- CSS link -->
